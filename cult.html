<h2> The Cult of Freddy </h2>

<h3> Freddy has a cult in this version. Because of course he does. </h3>

<h4> Actually, this was a pretty popular idea in the Freddy vs Jason script, being in
  nearly all the versions of the script (except, ironically, the final one). Though
they were most detailed in a cript by David J. Schow </h4>

  <h4> The cult would've consisted of a group of people called "fred heads", lead by
    the evil Dominick Cochran. They would wear christmas sweaters, porpusefully burn
    themselves, and sacrafice virigns to Freddy. Somehow. </h4>

    <h3> In this version, Jason is almost an after thought. He would've been revived
      by the cult throwing a dead teenager's heart into Campy Crystal Lake, which would've
      revived Jason. Apparently Jason now having Dracula powers of "blood=ressurection". </h3>
