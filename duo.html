<h3> In this draft, Freddy and Jason pull a Zak and Wheezie from Dragontales </h3>

<h4> I feel like that should be enough to show off the weirdness, but let's go further
  in depth </h4>

  <h4> In this ending, by writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore, Freddy and Jason's final
    climactic battle was meant to take place on top of a burning mall, where Freddy somehow
    manages to knock Jason out using nitrous oxide. Freddy tries to invade Jason's mind to
    reenter the dream world, but Jason wakes up halfway through the journey. </h4>

    <h3> This results in Freddy and Jason... well, merging. </h3>

   <h4> Not related to the ending, but in this script not only would Jason go to court,
     but it would've been revelaed that EVERY Friday the 13th movie up to this point was
     just that, a movie. And this Jason was the REAL Jason. </h4>

     <h3> I'm sure that would've gone over well. Though I guess it would explain why
      Jason is back from the future. and SPACE. </h3>
