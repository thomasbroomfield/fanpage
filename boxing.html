<h3> Yeah, you're reading that correctly. </h3>
  <h4> In the early stages of development for Freddy vs Jason, with a script penned by Lewis Abernathy (the writer of
    Titanic, no seriously), the ending was similar to what it is in the final product, where both Freddy and Jason die. However,
    unlike the one we got, where Jason walks out of the water with Freddy's head in hand, Jason and Freddy both go to hell, where they're locked
    in combat forever in a boxing ring made of entrails. </h4>

  <h3> Yes, this is real </h3>

  <h4> to make it better, villians of all shapes and sizes where supposed to be there. Such as Pinhead and...
    Adolf Hitler.</h4>

    <h4> Aight. </h4>
